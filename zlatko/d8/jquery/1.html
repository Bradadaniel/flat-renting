 There are two versions of jQuery available for downloading:

 Production version - this is for your live website because it has been minified and compressed
 Development version - this is for testing and development (uncompressed and readable code)

 Both versions can be downloaded from jQuery.com.

 The jQuery library is a single JavaScript file, and you reference it with the HTML
 <script> tag (notice that the <script> tag should be inside the <head> section):


 Basic syntax is: $(selector).action()

    A $ sign to define/access jQuery
    A (selector) to "query (or find)" HTML elements
    A jQuery action() to be performed on the element(s)

-->

    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js"></script>

    <script>
        $(document).ready(function () {

            $("input").click(function () {
                $("p").hide();
            });

            $("#sec").hover(function () {
                $("p").fadeIn("slow");
                $("p").html("Subotica Tech");
            });

        });

         The jQuery team has also created an even shorter method for the document ready event:

        $(function(){

                // jQuery methods go here...

            });
        */
    </script>
